Had a little love
But I spread it thin
Falling in her arms  and out again
I made a bad name for my game 'round town
Tore out my heart and shut it down

Nothing to do
Nowhere to be
A simple little a kind of free
Nothing to do
No one but me
And that's all I need

I'm perfectly lonely
I'm perfectly lonely
I'm perfectly lonely
Yeah
Cause I don't belong to anyone
And nobody belongs to me

I see my friends around from time to time
When the ladies let us slip away
And when they ask me how I'm doing with mine
This is always what I say

Nothing to do
Nowhere to be
A simple little kind of free
Nothing to do
No one to be
Is it really hard to see?

I'm perfectly lonely
I'm perfectly lonely
I'm perfectly lonely
Yeah
Cause I don't belong to anyone
And nobody belongs to me

And this is not to say
There never comes a day
I'll take my chances and start again
And when I look behind
On all my younger times
I have to thank the wrongs
That led me to a love so strong

I'm perfectly lonely
I'm perfectly lonely
I'm perfectly lonely
Yeah
Cause I don't belong to anyone
And nobody belongs to me

That's the way
That's the way
That's the way
That I want it

That's the way
That's the way
That's the way
That I want it

That's the way
That's the way
That's the way
That I want it

That's the way
That's the way
That's the way
That I want it

That's the way
That's the way
That's the way
That I want it

That's the way
That's the way
That's the way
That I want it

That's the way
That's the way
That's the way
That I want it

That's the way
That's the way
That's the way
That I want it
