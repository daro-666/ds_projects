I'm not alone
I wish I was
Cause then I'd know I was down because
I couldn't find a friend around
To love me like they do right now
They do right now

I'm dizzy from the shopping mall
I searched for joy but I bought it all
It doesn't help the hunger pain
An a thirst I'd have to drown first to
Ever satiate

[Chorus]
Something's missing
And I don't know how to fix it
Something's missing
And I don't know what it is
No I don't know what it is
At all

When autumn comes
It doesn't ask 
It just walks in where it left you last
You never know when it starts
Until there's fog inside the glass around
Your summer heart

[Chorus]

I can't be sure that this state of mind
Is not of my own design
I wish there was an over-the-counter test
For loneliness 
For loneliness like this

[Chorus]

Something's different
And I don't know what it is
No I don't know what it is
