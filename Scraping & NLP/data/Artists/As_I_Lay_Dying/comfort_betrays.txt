You sat and watched
As I nearly destroyed myself
Never had I felt so betrayed
That you would sacrifice my life
For no more than your comfort

And now your love means nothing
Nothing to me
Your love means nothing to me
Nothing to me

You are a coward
The antithesis of a friend
Take action before
There is no one left to defend

For I would have stood by you
For I would have stood by you
Right to the gates of hell

For I would have stood by you
Right to the gates of hell
Right to the gates of hell
