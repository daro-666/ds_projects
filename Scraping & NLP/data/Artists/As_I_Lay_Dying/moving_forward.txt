We're born helpless
But guided by humanity
What was compassion?
Soon controls the way we think

Familiarity has left me desensitized
And inanity keeps deception disguised

We are lost but keep moving forward
To find the truth we must turn around

History reveals an inviting
Sense of compromise
Our customs destroyed
What was once unique

Traditions started with useful intention
Now Subjugate those too numb to question

We are lost but keep moving forward
To find the truth we must turn around
We are lost!
To find the truth we must turn around

I desire to wake from Sedation
And begin to separate
The truth from tradition

We are lost but keep moving forward
To find the truth we must turn around
We are lost but keep moving forward
To find the truth we must turn around
We are lost but keep moving forward
To find the truth we must turn around
