Control is dead in this blind world 
For we do what we hate 
Split from inside 
Betrayed by emotion 
We must look past 
What is in front of us 
Shadows are security 
They have become the solace 
Of my looking glass heart 
In search for certainty 
I no longer need control 
Take me through the fire 
Refine what is yours 
It is time to overcome this 
We must look past 
What is in front of us
