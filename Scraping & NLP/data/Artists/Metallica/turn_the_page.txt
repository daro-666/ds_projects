On a long and lonesome highway, east of Omaha
You can listen to the engines moanin' out his one old song
Think about the woman or the girl you knew the night before
But your thoughts will soon be wanderin', the way they always do
When you're ridin' sixteen hours and there's nothin' much to do
And you don't feel much like ridin', you wish the trip was through
Here I am, on the road again, here I am, up on the stage
Here I go, playin' star again, there I go, turn the page

So you walk into this restaurant, all strung out from the road
And you feel the eyes upon you, as you're shakin' off the cold
You pretend it doesn't bother you, but you just want to explode (yeah, oh)

Most times you can't hear 'em talk, other times you can
All the same old clich√©'s, "is it woman, or is it man"
And you always seem outnumbered, you don't dare make your stand
Make your stand

Ah, here I am, on the road again, here I am, up on the stage
Here I go, playin' star again, there I go, turn the page
Whoa, hey

Out there in the spotlight, you're a million miles away
Every ounce of energy, you try and give away
As the sweat pours out your body, like the music that you play

Later in the evenin', as you lie awake in bed
With the echoes of the amplifiers, ringin' in your head
You smoke the day's last cigarette, rememberin' what she said
What she said

Oh, here I am, on the road again, here I am, up on that stage
Here I go, playin' star again, there I go, turn the page
Here I go, turn that page
Here I go, there I go, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, I'm a rock and roll god
Here I go
Here I go
Here I go, oh whoa
Here I go
