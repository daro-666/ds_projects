## Animated Visualization
In this project I explored the [Gapminder dataset](https://www.gapminder.org/data/) and created an interactive animated plot using [plotly-express](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/).

## CV & DeepLearning Classification
Here I used [openCV](https://opencv.org/) to take pictures of objects, trained a CNN using [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) to classify said pictures and finally combined the trained model with openCV to make live class predictions on new pictures.

## Classification (Supervised)
Had a go at kaggles famous [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview). Cleaned, selected and engineered relevant features and made survival predictions using several of [scikit-learns](https://scikit-learn.org/) classifiers.

## Dockerized Data Pipeline
Used reddit's api to extract posts from r/DataScience and saved them in a *postgreSQL* database. Extracted the post titles from the db, ran [sentiment analysis](https://pypi.org/project/vaderSentiment/) on them and uploaded post titles and sentiment scores to a *mongoDB*. Took the contents of the *mongoDB* and wrote a final python script to post the results to a slack channel. Lastly this ETL job was containerized using *docker*.

## Markov Simulation
Created a simulation of customers moving through a fictional supermarket based on markov chain principles through calculating and applying a transition probability matrix. The Supermarket and its customers where implemented as objects.
