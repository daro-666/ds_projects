## Animated Visualization
In this project I explored the [Gapminder dataset](https://www.gapminder.org/data/) and created an interactive animated plot using [plotly-express](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/).

## CV & DeepLearning Classification
Here I used [openCV](https://opencv.org/) to take pictures of objects, trained a CNN using [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) to classify said pictures and finally combined the trained model with openCV to make live class predictions on new pictures.

## Classification (Supervised)
Had a go at kaggles famous [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview). Cleaned, selected and engineered relevant data and made survival predictions using [scikit-learns](https://scikit-learn.org/) RandomForestClassifier.
